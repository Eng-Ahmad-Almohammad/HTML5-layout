## Headers & Footers
## < header > < footer >
### The < header > and < footer > elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

● A header or footer for an individual < article > or < section > within the page.
### In this example, the < header > element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The < footer > element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions. Each individual < article > and < section > element can also have its own < header > and < footer > elements to hold the header or footer information for that section within the page.
